# Roca_S.A-Graphs_DS_implementation

## Explanation

This project is an application of Graphs DS in C++, recreating an airline-consulting agency, the user can consult routes of Panam√°:
* consulting routes by distance
* consulting routes by time
* consulting routes by cost
* visualize all routes results in 2d matrices.

## Who is this for?

Anyone that ones a simple implementation of Graph-DS in C++.

## graphs

the graphs representation its done using adyacency matrices.
the shortest path algorith used is Dijkstra Algorithm.

## graphics

All graphics are done with OLC_Pixel_Game_Engine

## dependencies
All dependencies are included in the project, also the .exe file.
